Ashurbanipal
============

This is a small application to manage my library.
Build with Vaadin, and planned to be deployed on heroku.

What kind of name is that?
--------------------------

Projects have names, finding one isn't always easy. I like history, so that's where I take inspiration for names.
[Ashurbanipal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal) is the name of an ancient king
that made one of the if not the oldest known library.

Setup

Launcher is configured to use memcached for session management.
Setting the environment variable DEV_MODE to true will disable the memcached session management.
Started basic work using mongo db,
